Why?\itemThe teaching assistant does not want to take sides.He tells them that if $\signal(n)\cos2\pi f_0n$ and $\signal(n)\sin 2\pi f_0n$ were both available, $\signal(n)$ can be recovered.What does he have in mind?\end{problemparts}%*********\newpage\item \textbf{Digital Stereo}\\Just as with analog communication, it should be possible to send two signals simultaneously over a digital channel.Assume you have two CD-quality signals (each sampled at 44.1~kHz with 16~bits/sample).One suggested transmission scheme is to use a quadrature BPSK scheme.If $\bit^{(1)}(n)$ and $\bit^{(2)}(n)$ each represent a bit stream, the transmitted signal has the form\[\xmit(t) = \amplitude\sum_n \left[\bit^{(1)}(n)\sin 2\pi f_c (t-n\period)\pulse(t-n\period) + \bit^{(2)}(n)\cos 2\pi f_c (t-n\period)\pulse(t-n\period)\right]\]where $\pulse(t)$ is a unit-amplitude pulse having duration $\period$ and $\bit^{(1)}(n)$, $\bit^{(2)}(n)$ equal either $+1$ or $-1$ according to the bit being transmitted for each signal.The channel adds white noise and attenuates the transmitted signal.\begin{problemparts}\itemWhat value would you choose for the carrier frequency $f_c$?\itemWhat is the transmission bandwidth?\itemWhat receiver would you design that would yield both bit streams?\end{problemparts}%************\end{problems}\end{document}
