      As far as a communications engineer is concerned, signals
      express information.  Because systems manipulate signals, they
      also affect the information content.  Information comes neatly
      packaged in both analog and digital forms. Speech, for example,
      is clearly an analog signal, and computer files consist of a
      sequence of bytes, a form of "discrete-time" signal despite the
      fact that the index sequences byte position, not time sample.
      <emphasis>Communication systems</emphasis> endeavor not to
      manipulate information, but to transmit it from one place to
      another, so-called <term>point-to-point communication</term>,
      from one place to many others, <term>broadcast
      communication</term>, or from many to many, like a telephone
      conference call or a chat room. Communication systems can be
      fundamentally analog, like radio, or digital, like computer
      networks.

      This chapter develops a common theory that underlies how such
      systems work. We describe and analyze several such systems, some
      old like AM radio, some new like computer networks. The question
      as to which is better, analog or digital communication, has been
      answered, because of Claude
      Shannon's fundamental work on a theory of information
      published in 1948, the development of cheap, high-performance
      computers, and the creation of high-bandwidth communication
      systems.  <emphasis>The answer is to use a digital communication
      strategy</emphasis>. In most cases, you should convert all
      information-bearing signals into discrete-time,
      amplitude-quantized signals.  Fundamentally digital signals,
      like computer files (which are a special case of symbolic
      signals), are in the proper form. Because of the Sampling
      Theorem, we know how to convert analog signals into digital
      ones. Shannon showed that once in this form, <emphasis>a
      properly engineered system can communicate digital information
      with no error despite the fact that the communication channel
      thrusts noise onto all transmissions</emphasis>. This startling
      result has no counterpart in analog systems; AM radio will
      remain noisy. The convergence of these theoretical and
      engineering results on communications systems has had important
      consequences in other arenas. The audio compact disc (CD) and
      the digital videodisk (DVD) are now considered digital
      communications systems, with communication design considerations
      used throughout.

	Communications design begins with two fundamental
	considerations.

      <list id="questions" list-type="enumerated">
	<item>
	  What is the nature of the information source, and to what
	  extent can the receiver tolerate errors in the received
	  information?

	<item>
	  What are the channel's characteristics and how do they
	  affect the transmitted signal?</item>
      </list>
      
      In short, what are we going to send and how are we going to send
      it?  Interestingly, digital as well as analog transmission are
      accomplished using analog signals, like voltages in Ethernet (an
      example of <term>wireline</term> communications) and
      electromagnetic radiation (<term>wireless</term>) in cellular
      telephone.
