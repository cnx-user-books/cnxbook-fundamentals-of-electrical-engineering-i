      From its beginnings in the late nineteenth century, electrical
      engineering has blossomed from focusing on electrical circuits
      for power, telegraphy and telephony to focusing on a much
      broader range of disciplines.  However, the underlying themes
      are relevant today: <term>Power</term> creation and transmission
      and <term>information</term> have been the underlying themes of
      electrical engineering for a century and a half.  This course
      concentrates on the latter theme: the <emphasis>representation,
      manipulation, transmission, and reception of information by
      electrical means</emphasis>.  This course describes what
      information is, how engineers quantify information, and how
      electrical <term>signals</term> represent information.

      Information can take a variety of forms.  When you speak to a
      friend, your thoughts are translated by your brain into motor
      commands that cause various vocal tract components--the jaw, the
      tongue, the lips--to move in a coordinated fashion.  Information
      arises in your thoughts and is represented by speech, which must
      have a well defined, broadly known structure so that someone
      else can understand what you say.  Utterances convey information
      in sound pressure waves, which propagate to your friend's ear.
      There, sound energy is converted back to neural activity, and,
      if what you say makes sense, she understands what you say.  Your
      words could have been recorded on a compact disc (CD), mailed to
      your friend and listened to by her on her stereo.  Information
      can take the form of a text file you type into your word
      processor.  You might send the file via e-mail to a friend, who
      reads it and understands it.  From an information theoretic
      viewpoint, all of these scenarios are equivalent, although the
      forms of the information representation--sound waves, plastic
      and computer files--are very different.

      Engineers, who don't care about information
      <emphasis>content</emphasis>, categorize information into two
      different forms: <term>analog</term> and <term>digital</term>.
      Analog information is continuous valued; examples are audio and
      video.  Digital information is discrete valued; examples are
      text (like what you are reading now) and DNA sequences.

      The conversion of information-bearing signals from one energy
      form into another is known as <emphasis>energy
      conversion</emphasis> or <emphasis>transduction</emphasis>.  All
      conversion systems are inefficient since some input energy is
      lost as heat, but this loss does not necessarily mean that the
      conveyed information is lost. Conceptually we could use any form
      of energy to represent information, but electric signals are
      uniquely well-suited for information representation,
      transmission (signals can be broadcast from antennas or sent
      through wires), and manipulation (circuits can be built to
      reduce noise and computers can be used to modify information).
      Thus, we will be concerned with how to

      Telegraphy represents the earliest electrical information
      system, and it dates from 1837.  At that time, electrical
      science was largely empirical, and only those with experience
      and intuition could develop telegraph systems.  Electrical
      science came of age when <link url="http://www-groups.dcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Maxwell.html">James
      Clerk Maxwell</link> proclaimed in 1864 a set of equations that
      he claimed governed all electrical phenomena.  These equations
      predicted that light was an electromagnetic wave, and that
      energy could propagate.  Because of the complexity of Maxwell's
      presentation, the development of the telephone in 1876 was due
      largely to empirical work.  Once Heinrich Hertz confirmed
      Maxwell's prediction of what we now call radio waves in about
      1882, Maxwell's equations were simplified by Oliver Heaviside
      and others, and were widely read.  This understanding of
      fundamentals led to a quick succession of inventions--the
      wireless telegraph (1899), the vacuum tube (1905), and radio
      broadcasting--that marked the true emergence of the
      communications age.

      During the first part of the twentieth century, circuit theory
      and electromagnetic theory were all an electrical engineer
      needed to know to be qualified and produce first-rate designs.
      Consequently, circuit theory served as the foundation and the
      framework of all of electrical engineering education.  At
      mid-century, three "inventions" changed the ground rules.  These
      were the first public demonstration of the first electronic
      computer (1946), the invention of the transistor (1947), and the
      publication of <emphasis>A Mathematical Theory of
      Communication</emphasis> by <link url="http://www.lucent.com/minds/infotheory/">Claude
      Shannon</link> (1948).  Although conceived separately, these
      creations gave birth to the information age, in which digital
      and analog communication systems interact and compete for design
      preferences.  About twenty years later, the laser was invented,
      which opened even more design possibilities.  Thus, the primary
      focus shifted from <emphasis>how</emphasis> to build
      communication systems (the circuit theory era) to
      <emphasis>what</emphasis> communications systems were intended
      to accomplish.  Only once the intended system is specified can
      an implementation be selected.  Today's electrical engineer must
      be mindful of the system's ultimate goal, and understand the
      tradeoffs between digital and analog alternatives, and between
      hardware and software configurations in designing information
      systems.
